This file calculates the time needed to calculate the eigenvalues of a group of matrices. THe values of the coefficents are given in the 
Makefile. It is primarily linear in behaviour. The time.c is like time.c in the previous except that the eigen value calculator 
now also calculates the jacobi diagonalization. As a result I haven't commented much in this file.
