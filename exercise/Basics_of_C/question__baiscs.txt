-1 A main function is essentially an instructions manuel for the code on how to run the code to get the wished outcome.
-2 It is how file are run/compiled, one file requires another file to be created or it might require infromation in a third file to create a file it self. An example of the later would be .h files. The executable code tells the source code to create the object code.
-3 Manuelly? i dont think I get this question.
-4 you include stdio.h
-5 It i a stupidly usefull tool that you should always include as the first thing in any piece of code.
-6 Isn't this question spoiled by the Hint? man printf.
-7 float double long double 
-8 1
-9 I believe that you need math.h
-10 IT combines complex.h and math.h I don't know to be honest.
