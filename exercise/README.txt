Hello there.
This is a brief explaination of the numbering system.
Simply put the numbers indicated under which lecture they where given.
As an example: exercise8 is the exercise for lecture 8 on Multiprocessing.

Note I have palce READMEs in several files, although I recommend caution. Some are general explaination while others are reminders to myself.
