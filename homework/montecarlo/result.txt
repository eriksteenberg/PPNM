Part A

The values of the lists that we are integrating x**2 over as a test.
a[0]=0 and b[0]=3
The plain integration of x**2 gives 9.00053.
With an estimated error of 0.00254532
and an actual error of 0.000528662
We now calculate the given integral. 
The values of the lists that we are integrating over are
a[0]=0 and b[0]=3.14159
a[1]=0 and b[1]=3.14159
a[2]=0 and b[2]=3.14159
montecarlo plain integration of the given function gives 1.39936.
With an estimated error of 0.0114192
and an actual error of 0.0061558 

Part B

We test the quasi-random montecarlo integration of the same function as the one we used to test the pseudo-random integration,
which is the integral of x**2 from 0 to 3.
For the quasi-random montegral the integral is 8.99986
with an estiamted error of 5.25051e-05
and an actual error of 0.000142361
