First we test our root-finder og f(x)=(x-1)**2)
Our x vector

1
-2
27
33


Our f(x) vector

0
9
676
1024


The root of the f(x) vector. It is a good sign that all the entries are 1

1
1
1
1


Now for the Test on the  Rosenbrock's valley function, f(x,y) = (1-x)**2 + 100*(y-x**2)**2,
we search for the extremum points by applying our root finder on the derivatives of the function
These are randomly generated x0 and y0 values

0.840188
0.394383

The return x and y values are

1
1

Plucking them into the function, returns:

-0
0

When the derivates of a function are zero it is an extremum. So we have found what we wanted
